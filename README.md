/**
 * debugout generates a text file from your logs, which can be timestamp and downloaded. 
 * This can sychronously show console logs, debugs, info, warn, errors while saving the date in string format to 
 * your text file. 
 *
 * Works with multiple arguments pass, just like any other console. Currently in Chrome it supports DOM elements
 *
 * BUG:
 * In IE, when a DOM element is passed, it might cause a script error.
